Subject: [PATCH 0/2] HID: Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB gaming mouse driver and support for other Corsair devices
Cc: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org


Hi all,
Since I have a Corsair Scimitar PRO RGB that does not works on Linux, I
tried to find a solution doing some research but was not able to find any.

The kernel just complained about not being able to parse one of the report
descriptor items giving back an error -22, enabling the hid debug support I
could get more detailed information from the Kernel that was now reporting
`logical range invalid 0xfff 0x7f` by `hid-core.c`

Taking a look at the output of the /sys/kernel/debug/hid/DEVICE/rdesc
I noticed that one of the report items was using 0x15 and 0x16 items
consecutively for Logical Minimum and Logical Maximum, obviously the
latter one was wrong and it should be 0x26 (16 bits Logical Maximum)
instead of 0x16 (16 bits Logical Minimum).

Investigating this issue I also noticed `timeout initializing reports`
in both my box and my wifes for this and other Corsair new devices
(K65 and K70 RGB Rapidfire) so I also added new device ids and added
common quirks to fix it in drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-quirks.c

In the patchset, the first patch  adds support for K65-K70 new RGB
Rapidfire devices and the second one adds a new driver `hid-corsair-mouse.c`
to fix the Scimitar Pro RGB parsing problem.

I created the new mouse driver instead of add code to the already existent
`hid-corsair.c` as it seem quite common to split mouse and keyboard driver
support.

Best Regards,
Oscar Campos
